# Introduction

The best integration of GitHub Copilot is in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). As a rule of thumb, features are first released in VSCode before being made available in other editors, several days or weeks later. This means that if you want to get the most out of GitHub Copilot, you should use VSCode! This is why this guide focuses on VSCode, but the concepts and features are similar across other editors.

# Features overview - and what to expect from them

!!! note "Agent Mode"
    The most impressive display of GitHub Copilot's capabilities is probably the "Agent Mode" feature, which allows Copilot to interact with your codebase in a more conversational manner. We cover this feature in detail in the [Agent Mode](/ghc-vscode/agent-mode) section of this guide!

GitHub Copilot offers a range of features designed to enhance your coding experience. Here's a quick overview of what you can expect:
